# Axes

Axes is a small thought-game.

It is not a test.  
It has no correct answers.  
It does not try to explain anything.

## How to start

1. Open the file `Axes.game`
2. Copy its entire contents
3. Paste it into a prompt for an AI chat (tested with chatGPT5+ only)
4. Send

The game starts there.  
All questions and instructions are inside the game itself.

## What it is

Axes is a way to look at a thought, a feeling, or a situation  
from several independent directions at once.

Not to resolve it.  
Not to optimize it.  
Just to notice where you are.

## What you need to know

You don’t need preparation.  
You don’t need to be consistent.  
You don’t need to finish anything.

Stop at any moment.

## Notes

This is not about the author.  
If it works — use it.  
If it doesn’t — ignore it.

If you ever win Nobel's prize with it - you owe me a beer.
